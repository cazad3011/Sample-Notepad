This package is available on an "as is" basis. I do not say or imply that it will be useful for 
whatever you want to do with it. It may also contain bugs, and I assume no responsibility for 
any potential problems associated with its use. However,I have tried to fix almost bugs of my 
program. It has been tested on java version "1.8.0_92" on an Intel(R) Core(TM) CPU (i5) with a 2.20 GHz processor and 8.00 GB of RAM, running on the Windows 10 operating system.
